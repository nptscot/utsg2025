# Motivation

- Traditional transport models rely on limited datasets, leading to biases and blind spots [@lovelace2017].
- The 'data revolution' enables integration of open, proprietary, and crowdsourced data.
- Aim: Develop models that can easily integrate new data sources for more robust, future-proof transport planning.

# Introduction

- Historic models focus on commuting and simplified networks, missing active travel and non-work trips [@vybornova2024].
- Recent tools often focus on either behaviour or infrastructure, limiting scope [@vier√∏2024].
- The Network Planning Tool for Scotland (NPT) demonstrates a data-centric, integrative approach.

# Data Integration Approach

- NPT is designed to integrate a variety of data types: open, proprietary, and crowdsourced.
- Builds on prior work (e.g., CRUSE tool [@lovelace2024]) and integrates infrastructure and behavioural data.
- Over a dozen datasets combined for holistic transport analysis.

# Key Data Sources

1. **OpenStreetMap (OSM):** Crowdsourced, detailed paths and road attributes.
2. **OS OpenRoads:** Open-access, simplified UK road network.
3. **OS MasterMap Highways:** Detailed road widths and features.
4. **OS MasterMap Topography:** Detailed polygons for kerb lines, footways, etc.
5. Behavioural data: Census, Scottish Household Travel Survey, British National Travel Survey.

# Tools Developed and Used

- `mastermapr` (R): Efficient import/processing of OS MasterMap data.
- `osmactive` (R): Classifies OSM data, calculates pavement widths, identifies bus routes.
- `anime` (Rust): Fast, accurate network joining and enrichment.
- Enables harmonisation of raw, diverse datasets for NPT analysis.

# Results: NPT Web Application

- NPT web app (https://www.npt.scot) provides planners and public with insights into Scotland's transport network.
- Efficient rendering of large datasets (e.g., via `pmtiles`).
- Multiple interactive layers for scenario modelling and planning.

# Example Layers: Integrated Data

- **Route Network Layer:** Cycling potential from OSM and OS data.
- **Infrastructure & Traffic Layer:** Cycle infrastructure (from OSM, classified by `osmactive`) + modelled traffic.
- **Street Space Layer:** Road classifications by available width (OS MasterMap).
- **Core Network Layer:** Cohesive network for prioritising new infrastructure.
- **Network Planning Workspace:** Interactive tool for exploring and modelling changes.

# Discussion & Implications

- Integrating diverse data sources leads to more comprehensive, adaptable models.
- Open-source tools and methods promote reproducibility and flexibility.
- Key benefits: improved accuracy, multi-modal insights, transparency.
- Ongoing challenge: managing complexity and ensuring relevance as data volume grows.

# Future Work & References

- Incorporate more datasets (e.g., Scotland's Spatial Hub).
- Research efficient data processing and feature selection.
- Commitment to data diversity and robust integration is crucial for sustainable, equitable transport systems.
