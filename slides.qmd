# Motivation

::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="60%"}

-   Traditional transport models rely on limited datasets, leading to biases and blind spots [@lovelace2017].
-   The 'data revolution' enables integration of open, proprietary, and crowdsourced data.
-   Aim: Develop models that can easily integrate new data sources for more robust, future-proof transport planning.

## Introduction

::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="60%"}

-   Historic models focus on commuting and simplified networks, missing active travel and non-work trips [@vybornova2024].
-   Recent tools often focus on either behaviour or infrastructure, limiting scope [@vier√∏2024].
-   The Network Planning Tool for Scotland (NPT) demonstrates a data-centric, integrative approach.

# Data Integration

::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="60%"}

-   NPT is designed to integrate a variety of data types: open, proprietary, and crowdsourced.
-   Builds on prior work (e.g., CRUSE tool [@lovelace2024]) and integrates infrastructure and behavioural data.
-   Over a dozen datasets combined for holistic transport analysis.

# Key Data Sources

1.  **OpenStreetMap (OSM):** Crowdsourced, detailed paths and road attributes.
2.  **OS OpenRoads:** Open-access, simplified UK road network.
3.  **OS MasterMap Highways:** Detailed road widths and features.
4.  **OS MasterMap Topography:** Detailed polygons for kerb lines, footways, etc.
5.  Behavioural data: Census, Scottish Household Travel Survey, British National Travel Survey.

# Tools Developed and Used

-   `mastermapr` (R): Efficient import/processing of OS MasterMap data.
-   `osmactive` (R): Classifies OSM data, calculates pavement widths, identifies bus routes.
-   `anime` (Rust): Fast, accurate network joining and enrichment.
-   Enables harmonisation of raw, diverse datasets for NPT analysis.

# Results: NPT Web Application


-   NPT web app (https://www.npt.scot) provides planners and public with insights into Scotland's transport network.
-   Efficient rendering of large datasets (e.g., via `pmtiles`).
-   Multiple interactive layers for scenario modelling and planning.

# Live demo 

Give the tool a try at [www.npt.scot](https://www.npt.scot)!

# Example Layers: Integrated Data

-   **Route Network Layer:** Cycling potential from OSM and OS data.
-   **Infrastructure & Traffic Layer:** Cycle infrastructure (from OSM, classified by `osmactive`) + modelled traffic.
-   **Street Space Layer:** Road classifications by available width (OS MasterMap).
-   **Core Network Layer:** Cohesive network for prioritising new infrastructure.
-   **Network Planning Workspace:** Interactive tool for exploring and modelling changes.

# Discussion & Implications

-   Integrating diverse data sources leads to more comprehensive, adaptable models.
-   Open-source tools and methods promote reproducibility and flexibility.
-   Key benefits: improved accuracy, multi-modal insights, transparency.
-   Ongoing challenge: managing complexity and ensuring relevance as data volume grows.

# Future Work & References

-   Incorporate more datasets (e.g., Scotland's Spatial Hub).
-   Research efficient data processing and feature selection.
-   Commitment to data diversity and robust integration is crucial for sustainable, equitable transport systems.
