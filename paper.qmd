# Abstract

Transport models historically rely on limited input datasets, such as 'trip generators' and simplified networks, leading to biases and blind-spots.
This lack of data diversity can lead to biases and blind-spots in model outputs.
For example, over-reliance on commuting data over-emphasises arterial routes to historic employment centres, while motorised traffic datasets disproportionately highlight long-distance car trips and neglect active travel.
Transport models were developed at a time when data was scarce and expensive to collect but but the 'data revolution' has changed this.
We argue that models should be capable of integrating open, proprietary, and crowdsourced, datasets, with ease of integrating new data sources being a key design principle.
We present a case study of this approach in the Network Planning Tool for Scotland (NPT), which is publicly available at [npt.scot](https://www.npt.scot).
The NPT integrates data on transport infrastructure from 4 sources: OpenStreetMap, Ordnance Survey (OS) OpenRoads, OS MasterMap Highways, and OS Mastermap Topography, and we are planning to add more, including from the Scottish Spatial Hub, that integrates datasets from Scottish local authorities and partners.
Furthermore, the NPT integrates multiple datasets on transport behaviour (including from the Census, the Scottish Household Travel Survey and the British National Travel Survey), and scenarios of change based on international datasets, supporting more data-driven cycling strategies.
The results highlight the benefits of data integration, with results tending to improve as more data sources are added, and diminishing returns highlighting the importance of careful selection of input datasets.
The approach, based on reproducible code written in open source languages, can be generalised and packaged for benefit of others seeking develop future-proof modelling solutions to transport challenges.
We argue that integrating diverse data sources is essential for future-proof transport modelling, enabling adaptation to evolving travel patterns and behaviours.

# Introduction

The efficacy of transport models is increasingly tied to the diversity and richness of their input data.
Historically, models often relied on simplified networks and limited datasets (e.g., trip generators focused on commuting), potentially leading to biased outputs that overlook crucial aspects like active travel or non-work trips [@lovelace2017].
Previous strategic network planning tools have generally focused either on behaviour data or physical infrastructure, limiting their scope [@vybornova2024; @vierø2024].
The contemporary 'data revolution' offers an opportunity to transcend these limitations.
This paper argues for, and demonstrates, an approach where transport models are designed to seamlessly integrate a variety of data types—open, proprietary, and crowdsourced.
We present the Network Planning Tool for Scotland (NPT), publicly accessible at [npt.scot](https://www.npt.scot), as a case study.
Building on prior work on the Cycle Route Uptake and Scenario Estimation tool (CRUSE) [@lovelace2024], the NPT integrates multiple datasets, including transport infrastructure from OpenStreetMap (OSM) and Ordnance Survey (OS) products, alongside behavioural data from national travel surveys.

The NPT exemplifies this data-centric paradigm by integrating over a dozen datasets, including detailed infrastructure data from OpenStreetMap (OSM) and multiple Ordnance Survey (OS) products, alongside behavioural data from national travel surveys [@félix2025].
This integration supports a more holistic and nuanced understanding of transport systems, crucial for developing future-proof strategies that can adapt to evolving travel patterns and making transport planning more open and participatory [@lovelace2020a].

# Methods

The NPT's data integration framework leverages several key datasets and bespoke open-source tools.
Core network data includes:

1.  **OpenStreetMap (OSM)**: A rich, crowdsourced dataset providing granular details on paths, cycleways, and road attributes.

2.  **OS OpenRoads**: An open-access, simplified UK road network representation, ideal for baseline visualisations.

3.  **OS MasterMap Highways**: A detailed dataset with information on road widths and features.

4.  **OS MasterMap Topography**: The most detailed OS vector dataset, representing features like kerb lines and footways as polygons.

Importing and processing these diverse datasets, especially large ones like OS MasterMap (often exceeding 50GB compressed), presented challenges.
We developed and/or utilised tools including: - The `mastermapr` R package: Facilitates efficient import and processing of OS MasterMap data (see e.g., documentation at [github.com/acteng/mastermapr](https://github.com/acteng/mastermapr)).

-   The `osmactive` R package: Developed for this project, `osmactive` classifies OSM data based on attributes (e.g., `classify_cycle_infrastructure()`) and geographic relationships. For example, it calculates pavement widths from OS MasterMap Topography polygons associated with road segments (`get_pavement_widths()`) and identifies bus routes (`get_bus_routes()`).
-   anime: Approximate Network Integration, Matching and Enrichment, an algorithm implemented in a Rust crate that provides efficient and accurate network joining capabilities [@parry_josiahparryanime_2025].

These tools enable the transformation of raw, diverse datasets into harmonised inputs for the NPT.
For instance, carriageway widths from OS MasterMap Highways and footway widths derived from OS MasterMap Topography (using `osmactive`) are integrated to assess space for new active travel infrastructure, considering guidance such as Cycling by Design, which builds on Department for Transport guidance [@departmentfortransport2020].
Speed limit data from OSM is used to determine appropriate buffer widths for cycle infrastructure.

# Results

The primary outcome of this data integration strategy is the NPT web application ([npt.scot](https://www.npt.scot)), which provides planners and the public with multifaceted insights into Scotland's transport network, using efficient rendering of large datasets via `pmtiles` [@gonçalves2023].
Key layers demonstrating the power of integrated data include:

 - **Route Network Layer**: Presents cycling potential on networks derived from both OSM and simplified OS data [@lovelace_reproducible_2024], allowing comparison and scenario modelling.
- **Infrastructure and Traffic Layer**: Combines data on existing cycle infrastructure (from OSM, classified by `osmactive` as shown in @fig-glasgow-utsg) with modelled motor traffic levels.
- **Street Space Layer**: A novel national-level dataset visualising road classifications based on combined carriageway and corridor widths (derived from OS MasterMap products).
This layer, illustrated by @fig-street-space-utsg, helps identify opportunities for reallocating street space, crucial for active travel interventions.
- **Core Network Layer**: Represents a cohesive network that could be prioritised for new infrastructure, building on concepts of network coherence [@szell2021].
- **Network Planning Workspace (NPW)**: An interactive component ([nptscot.github.io/npw/](https://nptscot.github.io/npw/)) allowing users to explore data and model infrastructure changes.

The integration allows for a richer analysis than single-source data would permit.
@fig-glasgow-utsg shows detailed cycle infrastructure classification from OSM.
This data is more useful when viewed in combination with OS-derived road widths and traffic data within the NPT [@fig-street-space-utsg].
Together, these layers provide a comprehensive basis for network planning.
The ability to synthesise information, such as identifying roads with sufficient width for new cycle tracks (based on OS data) that also align with high cycling potential routes (partly OSM-derived), is a key benefit.
As noted in our initial abstract, results tend to improve with more data sources, though careful selection is vital to manage complexity and ensure relevance.

# Discussion

The NPT case study underscores the potential benefits of integrating diverse data sources in transport modelling.
By moving beyond traditional, often siloed, datasets, we can create models that are more comprehensive, and reflective of real-world complexities.
This approach directly addresses the need for "future-proof" transport modelling—systems that can adapt to new data streams, evolving policy priorities (e.g., decarbonisation, active travel promotion), and changing travel behaviours.

The potential benefits are manifold: improved accuracy in identifying intervention opportunities, enhanced understanding of multi-modal interactions, and greater transparency and flexibility through the use of open data and tools where possible.
The open-source nature of key components like `osmactive` and `anime` further promotes reproducibility and allows the methods to be adapted for other regions or modelling challenges.

Future work will focus on incorporating additional datasets, such as those from Scotland's Spatial Hub, further enriching the NPT's analytical capabilities.
The challenge of "diminishing returns" with increasing data volume necessitates ongoing research into efficient data processing, feature selection, and maintaining model parsimony while maximising explanatory power.
Ultimately, a commitment to data diversity and robust integration methodologies is crucial for advancing transport planning and developing sustainable, equitable transport systems.
